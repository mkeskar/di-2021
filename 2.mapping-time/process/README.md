Description of the contents of this folder and the logic of your data â†’ retinal variables mapping.

Clock 01
The outer ring represents hours, with the circle indicating the specific hour. The changing hue indicates shift from morning to night. In the center, there is an arrow. The angle this arrow point indicates how many minutes have passed. 90 deg = 15 minutes. Inside the arrow one can see a gradient. The percentage of the arrow filled by black indicates the percentage of the hour that has passed. The 5 dots leading up to the arrow blink in sequence to count seconds, and "fill" up the arrow.

Clock 02
This timekeepr utilizes series of shapes to represent seconds, minutes and hours. 60 circles represent seconds. Each second passes, an additional circle is filled. At the same time, the bar below  		  (representing minutes) fills up. When the bar fills completely, the next of the 24 squares changes. This change could be shift in position, value, or shape.

Clock 03
In this timekeeper, we are presented with a graphical visualization. The parabolic line indicates hours, with the origin indicating 12AM, the peak indicating 12PM and as the circle indicator approaches the end it indicates time is almost 12AM again. Below the arc is a semi-circle. The percentage filled with a changed value indicates how many minutes have passed in the hour. 1/4 = 15 min, etc. At the very bottom is a bar for seconds. A small indicator fluidly travels back and forth, with one cycle from left to right and back to left indicating 60 seconds of time passing.
